# Summary
Deformation & Octree LOD support working with the base Marching cubes implementation.
Deformation builds from the work done in base Marching Cubes, and Vertex factory branches.

Runtime test tools
LOD levels are set by distance from the cube- drag the cube tool in runtime to see the LOD in action.
Drag the sphere tool around the world to see deformation in the scene by erasing areas of the voxel body tha come in contact with the tool.
